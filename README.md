Crop Recommendation System:
The Crop Recommendation System is a dynamic Java application designed to help farmers and agricultural enthusiasts choose the best crops based on soil type and moisture levels. By leveraging pre-defined datasets, the application suggests the most suitable crops for various combinations of soil conditions and moisture percentages. The goal of this tool is to support decision-making in agriculture, ultimately contributing to better productivity and sustainability.

Key Features:
Dynamic Input: The user provides soil type and moisture level as inputs.
Crop Suggestions: The application recommends crops based on the given input by referencing an embedded dataset.
Self-Contained: The dataset is embedded directly into the Java code, eliminating the need for external files and ensuring easy deployment and use.
User-Friendly: Simple prompts guide users through inputting soil and moisture details, and the system responds with suitable crop recommendations.
Example Usage:
Input: Enter Loamy for soil type and 55 for moisture level.
Output: The system recommends Wheat and Barley as the most suitable crops.
Important Note:
Java is case-sensitive! When entering inputs like soil types (e.g., Loamy), make sure to match the case exactly as expected by the application.

This application aims to simplify agricultural decisions, promote sustainable farming, and help achieve the global goal of "Zero Hunger."
